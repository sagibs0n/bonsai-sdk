# Library Overview

The Bonsai libraries known as `libbonsai` (C++) and `bonsai_ai` (Python) wrap the Bonsai API to simplify the process of building simulators in C++ and Python programming languages. This Python library is compatible with Python 2.7+ and Python 3+ on Windows 7/10, macOS, and Linux.

When the AI Engine trains with the simulator it works in a loop. First, the simulator connects and registers itself with the AI Engine. Then, the simulator sends the AI Engine a state and the value of any objectives or rewards; next, the AI Engine replies with an action. The simulator then uses this action to advance the simulation and compute a new state. This “send state, receive action” process is repeated until training stops. At any time the AI engine may stop, reconfigure, and reset the simulator. After doing so it will either restart this training loop or stop training. A single state, action, next state, loop is sometimes referred to as an “iteration”.

The `Config` object has a built in command line parser which can be used to override the local running environment. It comes with a set of standard switches which can be viewed with the `--help` option. The current default configuration is read from environment variables, a `~/.bonsai` configuration file in the user’s home directory, a `./.bonsai` and a `./.brains` configuration file in the current working directory, command line options, and programmatically in code.
