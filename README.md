# Bonsai Python SDK

The Bonsai SDK is a framework and set of tools for interacting with the Bonsai platform. It is used both as a platform for internally developed simulator platform plugins and externally developed simulators.

This repository includes an example python library (`bonsai3-py`) and two example simulators.

## Documentation
Full documentation for Bonsai's Platform can be found at [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bonsai/](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bonsai/).

You can also use Pydoc for standard Python documentation built into this library.
